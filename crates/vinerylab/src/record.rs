//! Records the viewer window into a video file, one captured frame per video
//! frame.
//!
//! What it is for: recording a demo of the params panel. Committing a slider
//! rebuilds the scene and stalls the window for tens to hundreds of
//! milliseconds, and a screen recorder keeps every one of those stalls as a
//! freeze. Here the video's clock is the frame count, so a rebuild costs one
//! frame however long it took.
//!
//! ```text
//! VINERYLAB_RECORD=demo.mp4 cargo run --release
//! ```
//!
//! It covers the whole run: recording starts with the app and the file is
//! finished when the window closes. [`FPS_ENV`] sets the rate (default
//! [`FPS`]); frames between two due ones are not captured, so everything but a
//! stall plays back at the speed it happened.
//!
//! Frames are piped to `ffmpeg`, which has to be on `PATH`. That keeps a video
//! encoder out of the dependency tree, and makes the container whatever the
//! file extension says.
